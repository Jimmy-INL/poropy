Getting Started With poropy
===========================

Background
----------

:mod:`poropy` is a set of simple tools related to optimization of
in-core fuel management.  This includes loading pattern optimization,
for which :mod:`poropy.coretools` provides several tools.  For 
optimizing bundles (enrichment, gad content, etc.), :mod:`poropy.bundletools`
will provide utilities.

Building poropy
---------------

Currently, a build system is not in place, but the brave user will need to

* get `pypgapack <http://github.com/robertsj/pypgapack/>`_ (if optimization is desired)
* get `flare <http://github.com/robertsj/flare/>`_ (for neutronics)
* (and/or) build labanx (ifort -o labanx labanpel.f90) and put it in the PATH
* get python-qt4 and python-qt4-gl for the gui

All our work is done in Ubuntu; if someone want to write a setup.py for us,
we'd be thrilled!

Next Steps
----------

The user is encouraged to see the collection of 
:ref:`sec_examples`, which
includes optimization of a simple core.
