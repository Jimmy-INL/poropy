History
-------

``poropy`` was originally created by J. Roberts as a project 
for 22.251, a nuclear fuel cycle class at MIT taught at the 
time by Kord Smith.  That original implementation formed the
simple base components for optimizing loading patterns using
a simple neutronics module (a Python-wrapped executable) and
a genetic algorithm.

For the same class, N. Horelik and N. Gibson put together a
simple two group data module based on a variety of fits to
hundreds of CASMO-4 runs of typical assembly types.  This
data module has been folded into the ``poropy`` framework.

GUI development has been led by N. Horelik, and much of the
user experience is based on all our time in Waltham, MA 
playing with Studsvik's XIMAGE.  

Collaborations
--------------

While ``poropy`` is in its infancy, we are interested in 
collaborations in all areas, including:

* Including a thermal hydraulic engine of a similar fidelity
  to the extant data module; our data module will need to be
  extended a bit, but ultimately we won't be able to include
  things like history effects (unless someone has a really 
  good idea...)
* Additional optimization approaches; currently, we have 
  the genetic algorithm; several greedy heuristic 
  methods are in ongoing development
* Porting to other architectures; all our development is 
  in Ubuntu.  We'd love to drag and drop assemblies on
  an iPad.
* Educational materials; a primary motivator for continued 
  development is to produce a tool viable for classroom
