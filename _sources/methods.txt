Methods
=======

This chapter briefly describes some of the methods used in
``poropy``.  Original documentation is attached where
applicable.



Nuclear Data
------------

See :download:`nuclear data report <datatheory.pdf>`.


Neutronics
----------

Currently, ``poropy`` has two neutronics options, one based
on a crude python wrapper around an old Fortran code LABAN-PEL,
and the other based on a simple FLARE implementation.  

Details
on LABAN-PEL are best left to original documentation; see, 
for example to be continued.

The FLARE model is quite simple.  To be continued.


Optimization
------------

The optimization capability of ``poropy`` is currently based
on the genetic algorithm library PGAPack, used through the 
Python wrapped version
`pypgapack <http://github.com/robertsj/pypgapack/>`_.

The literature is full of work on loading pattern optimization.
The original ``poropy`` project report gives a short survey
of some of this work, along with a tutorial on genetic algorithms
and how they can be applied to loading pattern optimization.
See :download:`optimzation report <optimizationtheory.pdf>`.
